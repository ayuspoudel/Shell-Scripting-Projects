# Shell Scripting Projects and Documentation

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of shell scripting projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project is designed to demonstrate various aspects of shell scripting, including file management, process automation, system monitoring, and cloud resource management using AWS services.

## Repository Structure

- [`/cpp-shell-scripting-project/`](./cpp-shell-scripting-project/): Contains a shell script project that demonstrates creating, compiling, and executing C++ files using shell scripting.
- [`/AWS-Shell-Scripting-Project/`](./AWS-Shell-Scripting-Project/): Contains a shell script for tracking and reporting usage of various AWS services within your AWS account.
- [`/advanced-projects/`](./advanced-projects/): *(Coming Soon)* Will contain more complex and advanced shell scripting projects covering a wide range of use cases.

## Project: C++ Shell Scripting Project

### Objective

This project automates the process of creating, writing, compiling, and executing simple C++ programs using a shell script. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of file manipulation, compilation, and execution automation through shell commands.

### Files Included

- **`name.cpp`**: A C++ program that prints `"Ayush Poudel"`.
- **`country.cpp`**: A C++ program that prints `"Nepal"`.
- **`first_shell_script.sh`**: A shell script that automates the creation, compilation, and execution of the above C++ files.
- **`print_name`**: Compiled executable for `name.cpp`.
- **`print_country`**: Compiled executable for `country.cpp`.

### How It Works

1. **Creating C++ Files**: The shell script uses the `touch` command to create two C++ source files: `name.cpp` and `country.cpp`.

2. **Writing C++ Code**: It utilizes `echo` commands to write simple C++ code into the respective files, each designed to print a specific string to the console.

3. **Compiling the Files**: The script compiles the C++ source files using `g++`, producing executable binaries named `print_name` and `print_country`.

4. **Executing the Binaries**: Finally, the script runs the executables, which output the predefined strings to the console.

### How to Run

#### Prerequisites

- **GCC Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` installed on your system.
- **Shell Environment**: A Unix-like shell environment (e.g., Bash).

#### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Shell-Scripting-Projects-and-Documentation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Shell-Scripting-Projects-and-Documentation/cpp-shell-scripting-project
   ```

3. **Make the Shell Script Executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x first_shell_script.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   ./first_shell_script.sh
   ```

5. **Expected Output**:

   ```
   Ayush Poudel
   Nepal
   ```

## Project: AWS Usage Reporting Script

### Objective

This project provides a shell script to track and report the usage of various AWS services within your AWS account. It generates a consolidated report detailing the current state of resources such as S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users.

### Author

- **Name**: Ayush Poudel
- **Date**: September 1, 2024
- **Version**: V1

### Files Included

- **`aws_resource_tracker.sh`**: The main script that retrieves and logs information about AWS resources.
- **`resource_tracker`**: Output file generated by the script containing the detailed report.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation and usage instructions for the AWS Usage Reporting Script.

### How It Works

1. **S3 Buckets**: Lists all S3 buckets in your AWS account and appends the information to the `resource_tracker` file.

2. **EC2 Instances**: Retrieves all EC2 instance IDs using AWS CLI and formats the output using `jq`, appending the results to the `resource_tracker` file.

3. **AWS Lambda Functions**: Lists all Lambda functions available in your AWS account and appends the details to the `resource_tracker` file.

4. **IAM Users**: Lists all IAM users and appends the information to the `resource_tracker` file.

5. **Debugging**: The script uses `set -x` to enable debugging, printing each command to the terminal as it is executed for troubleshooting purposes.

### Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with necessary permissions.
  - **Installation**: [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  
- **jq**: A command-line JSON processor.
  - **Installation Commands**:
    - **macOS**:
      ```bash
      brew install jq
      ```
    - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install jq
      ```
    - **CentOS/RHEL**:
      ```bash
      sudo yum install jq
      ```
    - **Windows**:
      ```bash
      choco install jq
      ```

### How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Shell-Scripting-Projects-and-Documentation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the AWS Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Shell-Scripting-Projects-and-Documentation/AWS-Shell-Scripting-Project
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x aws_resource_tracker.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   ./aws_resource_tracker.sh
   ```

5. **View the Report**:

   The script generates a file named `resource_tracker` in the current directory. View the report using:

   ```bash
   cat resource_tracker
   ```

### Script Breakdown

#### S3 Buckets

```bash
aws s3 ls >> resource_tracker
```

- Lists all S3 buckets and appends the list to `resource_tracker`.

#### EC2 Instances

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances | jq '.Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' >> resource_tracker
```

- Describes all EC2 instances and extracts their Instance IDs using `jq`, appending the results to `resource_tracker`.

#### AWS Lambda Functions

```bash
aws lambda list-functions | jq '.Functions[].FunctionName' >> resource_tracker
```

- Lists all Lambda functions and extracts their names, appending them to `resource_tracker`.

#### IAM Users

```bash
aws iam list-users | jq '.Users[].UserName' >> resource_tracker
```

- Lists all IAM users and extracts their usernames, appending them to `resource_tracker`.

### Debugging

- The script uses debugging mode to trace command execution:

  ```bash
  set -x
  ```

- To disable debugging, comment out or remove the `set -x` line.

### Notes

- **AWS Credentials**: Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials and permissions.
- **Output File Location**: The `resource_tracker` file is created in the directory where the script is executed.
- **Error Handling**: Currently, the script does not implement extensive error handling; ensure all commands execute successfully or modify the script to handle errors as needed.

### Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error checks and handling mechanisms.
- **Email Notifications**: Add functionality to automatically email the generated report to specified recipients.
- **Additional Services**: Extend the script to include monitoring of other AWS services such as RDS, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch metrics.
- **Scheduling**: Set up automated execution using cron jobs for periodic reporting.
- **Logging**: Implement detailed logging for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
